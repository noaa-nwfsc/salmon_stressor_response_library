# Description

Vision: To host an electronic library of Pacific salmon stressor-response functions as a “one-stop-shop” for life cycle modelers that is searchable, user-friendly, and open-source.

This e-Library will:

- store stressor-response functions for different species, life stages, and environmental stressors
- make it easier for modelers and model users to find the most appropriate relationships for the target species and region
- increase transparency because users can examine the sources informing relationships used in models
- produce economies of scale, efficiencies, and a reduction in redundant work across different modeling teams

# User Guide

## Stressor Response Metadata and Data Documentation

This e-library is designed to support life cycle modelers, resource managers, and scientists by making stressor-response (SR) functions discoverable, transparent, and reusable. Each SR function describes the quantitative relationship between a stressor (e.g., temperature, flow, harvest, contaminants) and a biological response (e.g., survival, growth, migration timing, capacity, productivity).

The library contains two main components:

1. **Metadata** - standardized fields describing the SR function, its source, and context
1. **Extracted data** - numerical data extracted from the article (or supplemental datasets) that has been formatted for reuse and analysis

## Metadata Fields

Each entry has an identifier and descriptive metadata fields.
| Field | Description |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Article ID | Identifier for the SR function. Links metadata to the associated dataset |
| Citation | Full citation of the primary research article |
| Stressor Title | Title of the SR function. Format: _Author et al. Year: Function description. Example: Honea et al. 2016: Chinook egg-to-fry survival vs incubation temperature_ |
| Species Common | Common species name (e.g., Chinook salmon, Sockeye salmon) |
| Species Latin Name | Genus species name (e.g., _Oncorhynchus kisutch_, _Oncorhynchus tshawytscha_) |
| Life Stage | Life stage of fish (e.g., fry, smolt, adult, egg) |
| Activity | Fish activity examined (e.g., incubation, spawning, rearing, migration) |
| Season | Season relevant to the study (e.g., spring, summer, fall, winter) |
| Response | Biological response measured (e.g., egg-to-fry survival, smolt abundance, growth) |
| Stressor Name | General stressor on the x-axis (e.g., temperature, angling effort, alkalinity) |
| Specific Stressor Metric | Specific metric of the stressor (e.g., incubation temperature, incidental angling mortality) |
| Stressor Units | Units of measurements (e.g., mg/L, %, ℃) |
| Function Derivation | Short summary of how the SR function was derived (e.g., lab trials, field data) |
| Detailed Function Derivation | Provides a transparent, comprehensive description of how the SR function was derived, including data and methods. This section should allow a reader to reconstruct the function’s logic and assumptions. |
| Transferability of Function | Evaluates whether the SR function can be applied beyond the specific context in which it was developed. This helps users understand the limits of generalization. |
| Research Article Type | Type of article (e.g., meta-analysis, field experiment, lab experiment, mechanistic model) |
| References | Citations for additional sources if the SR function draws on multiple papers |
| Stressor Data Source | Source of stressor data if not directly from the primary article |
| Location (Country) | Country where the study was conducted |
| Location (State) | State or province |
| Location (Watershed/Laboratory) | Watershed or Laboratory or Hatchery |
| Location (River/Creek) | River or Creek, if applicable |

## Extracted Data

When you download an SR function as a CSV, you receive:

1. Metadata (all fields above), and
1. Extracted data table - numerical data pulled from figures, tables, or supplementary files.

_Note: All extracted data entries include numeric Stressor (x) and Response (y) values and are associated with a single stressor per SRF entry. Each entry is fully labeled with a Stressor Label, Response Label, and corresponding units to ensure interpretability. Where multiple curves are present for the same stressor, they are distinguished using a curve identifier and, when applicable, a stressor value describing the curve. Early entries contributed by Canadian partners (e.g., CEMPRA, Joe Model) reported the biological response as Mean System Capacity, which scaled response values from 0% to 100%. Since NOAA assumed responsibility for stewardship of the library and expanded its scope, response values have been retained in the original units and formats reported in each source study, rather than standardized across entries. Extracted data may originate from reported tables, supplemental datasets, or digitized figures. When data are digitized from figures, small uncertainties may be introduced; these are documented where possible._
